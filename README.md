# My Learning Experience

Actually, I learnt a lot in a short span of time.  
It was very useful for my future.

- I learnt to write and execute Bash scripts (not completely).
- I learnt about Morse code (though I don’t remember it now).
- I learnt Euler's and Quaternion systems for rotation—not completely, but I know the basics and formulas.
- I learnt how to use a file as input (file handling) in C programming.
- I learnt Markdown (not completely).
- I learnt how to create a GitHub repo and push code to it.
- And most importantly: I learnt how to install Ubuntu or dual boot the system.

# Challenges Faced

Actually, I was waiting to write this.  
I never thought I would face this many challenges in such a short span of time.

- I dual-booted my system successfully and started working on it.
- Then, suddenly my Ubuntu screen started flickering.
- I asked an AI what to do.
- It gave me some instructions—I followed them blindly, and it messed up the graphics system.
- I had to delete and reinstall Ubuntu.
- Again, I asked AI for help—it gave me some more instructions and I lost Windows completely.
- My system had no operating system at all.
- I spent 8 hours installing Windows again using my friend's laptop.
- Finally, I got my Windows back, but my work was lost.
- I felt really depressed and thought of giving up.

But I didn't quit.  
I was determined and continued the task.  

Now, I’ve faced even more challenges due to lack of knowledge,  
but I learnt from them—and that’s the best part.

# My Approach

My approach is simple:

> I really didn’t know anything at the start.

But since I was determined, I kept learning—  
Not everything completely, but I got the basics down.

That’s my approach:  
Learn and solve by myself.

# Resources Used

To be honest, I used a lot of resources, but here are the main ones:

- YouTube videos for Bash scripting
- Faraday Academy for Markdown basics  
- ChatGPT to learn dual booting, GitHub usage, and troubleshooting  
- Various websites for Euler’s and Quaternion systems
